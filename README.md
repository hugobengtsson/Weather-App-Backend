# Weather-App


This is a school project where the assignment was to fetch data from an external API from our own backend. 

I have made this project a bit more complicated than what was required from the assignment. Therefore, both the app and backend will need some small tweaking to get going. 
You will need to install two different repositories to be able to run the project.

How to run the app: 

# npm i
# Add apiKeys.ts with an exported variable named "geoNamesUserName" with your username for GeoNames API.
# npm start

To run the mobile app you will need a simulator, I have used a simulator from Xcode. Alternativly run the app on your phone download "Expo Go" from AppStore. When you have the app you can simply scan the QR-code shown in the terminal window.
